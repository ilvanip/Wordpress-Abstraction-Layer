# WAL - The Wordpress Abstraction Layer
> A template to achieve the most basic functionality of a Wordpress site.

#### While building my first Wordpress site, I quickly realized that there is some important functionality that commonly exists for both Wordpress and non-Wordpress applications.
#### My earliest struggle was finding documentation, correct examples and explanation of how various actions are achieved in Wordpress.
#### Unable to find the everything in a uniform way, it was some time before I had something working.
#### This repository is an attempt to abstract all of those details away from the beginner and provides an easy template that can be adapted to quickly get something "up and running".

# Disclaimer regarding the use of this repository:
#### This repository is not the be-all and end-all of Wordpress. There may be better resources and documentation elsewhere and you are free to refer to those as well.
#### The code examples provided are incomplete and cannot be used as-is as this is just a template. You will have to fill in the blanks yourself.
